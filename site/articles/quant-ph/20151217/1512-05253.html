    <h1>Resonant interaction between two correlated atoms with frequency inside a photonic crystal bandgap. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Valentina Notararigo, Roberto Passante, Lucia Rizzuto</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>We consider the resonant interaction energy and force between two identical
atoms, one in an excited state and the other in the ground state, interacting
with the quantum electromagnetic field in the vacuum state and placed inside a
photonic crystal. The two atoms are prepared in their symmetric or
antisymmetric entangled state; the atomic excitation is thus distributed among
the atoms. This problem is also strictly related to the coherent resonant
energy transfer between two atoms. We consider the case of an atomic transition
frequency inside the frequency gap of the photonic crystal and in proximity of
the lower edge of its first band gap. We show that in this case the resonant
interaction energy asymptotically decreases as $1/{r^2}$, compared with the
$1/r$ dependence in both cases of free space and atomic frequency outside the
photonic crystal gap. We argue that, although the resonant force is reduced by
the presence of the photonic crystal, the configuration considered can be a
good candidate for the observation of the resonant interaction because
spontaneous emission is strongly suppressed and the correlated state is thus
preserved by the decoherence effect due to its spontaneous decay.
