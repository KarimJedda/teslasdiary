    <h1>In Appreciation of Abner Shimony. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Gregg Jaeger</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>Abner Shimony was an exceptional human being and a remarkably lucid and
penetrating thinker whose work centered on some of the most significant
physical and philosophical questions of his era at their nexus. He approached
these questions with an open, agile and critical mind, something quickly
evident to anyone who had the privilege of conversing with him. His choice of
problems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the
relationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly,
most of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his
enormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both
theoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of
physical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in
the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is
his pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the
early-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship
between knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical
concerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.
Indeed, the most well known phrase he coined is "experimental metaphysics." He
is also known for the reapplication of the expression "peaceful coexistence" as
pertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special
relativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the
question of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few
physicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more
philosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation
reflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual
career, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of
his teachers.
