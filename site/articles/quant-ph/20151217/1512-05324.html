    <h1>Operational meaning of quantum measures of recovery. </h1>

        <p>Several information measures have recently been defined which capture the
notion of "recoverability" of a tripartite quantum state. In particular, the
fidelity of recovery quantifies how well one can recover a system $A$ of a
tripartite state, defined on systems $ABC$, by acting on system $C$ alone. The
relative entropy of recovery is an associated measure in which the fidelity is
replaced by relative entropy. The fact that state recoverability plays a key
role in applications such as quantum key distribution and error correction
suggests that we should try to understand the property of recoverability in
more detail. In this paper, we provide concrete operational interpretations of
the aforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision
problem and a hypothesis testing scenario, each of which is connected to the
notion of recovery. Specifically, we show that the fidelity of recovery is
equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally unbounded quantum
prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum verifier that a given
quantum state is recoverable. This places the associated decision problem in
QIP and establishes it as hard for QSZK (a class of problems believed to be
difficult to solve even for a quantum computer). We also prove that the
regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the optimal Type II error
exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a tripartite state from a
recovered version of this state, such that the Type I error is constrained to
be no larger than a specified constant.
