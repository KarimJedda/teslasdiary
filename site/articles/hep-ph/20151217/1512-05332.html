    <h1>Interpreting a 750 GeV Diphoton Resonance. </h1>

        <p>We discuss the implications of significant excesses in the diphoton final
state observed by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS around 750 GeV diphoton
invariant mass. Interpreting the result as a spin-zero s-channel resonance, the
excess alone implies model-independent lower bounds on both the branching ratio
and the coupling to photons, leading to stringent constraints on dynamical
models. We consider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and
a broad resonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed
couplings and branching fractions to various other final states, by including
the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts to
construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific models,
our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the presence
of only an additional singlet or doublet spin zero field and the Standard Model
degrees of freedom; this includes all Two-Higgs-doublet-models. We prove that
the whole parameter space of the MSSM is ruled out as an explanation for the
excess if the absence of charge and colour breaking minima is required. If we
assume that the resonance is broad we find that it is challenging to find a
weakly coupled explanation. However, we provide an existence proof in the form
of a vectorlike model of quarks with exotic electric charge of 5/3 or above.
For the narrow resonance case a similar model with ordinary changes can be
perturbative up high scales. We also consider dilaton models, and they appear
to be inconsistent with the data, even if arbitrary extra contributions to the
QED and QCD beta functions are allowed. Prospects for the LHC run II and some
implications for flavor physics are briefly discussed.
