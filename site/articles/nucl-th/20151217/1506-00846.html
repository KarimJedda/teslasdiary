    <h1>Relativistic Causal Hydrodynamics Derived from Boltzmann Equation: a novel reduction theoretical approach. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Kyosuke Tsumura, Yuta Kikuchi, Teiji Kunihiro</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>We derive the second-order hydrodynamic equation and the microscopic formulae
of the relaxation times as well as the transport coefficients systematically
from the relativistic Boltzmann equation. Our derivation is based on a novel
development of the renormalization-group method, a powerful reduction theory of
dynamical systems, which has been applied successfully to derive the
non-relativistic second-order hydrodynamic equation Our theory nicely gives a
compact expression of the deviation of the distribution function in terms of
the linearized collision operator, which is different from those used as an
ansatz in the conventional fourteen-moment method. It is confirmed that the
resultant microscopic expressions of the transport coefficients coincide with
those derived in the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Furthermore, we show that
the microscopic expressions of the relaxation times have natural and physically
plausible forms. We prove that the propagating velocities of the fluctuations
of the hydrodynamical variables do not exceed the light velocity, and hence our
seconder-order equation ensures the desired causality. It is also confirmed
that the equilibrium state is stable for any perturbation described by our
equation.
