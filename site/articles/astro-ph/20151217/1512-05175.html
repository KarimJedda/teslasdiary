        <p>Giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star (hot Jupiters) are
subject to tidal forces expected to synchronize their rotational and orbital
periods on short timescales (tidal locking). However, spin rotation has never
been measured directly for hot Jupiters. Furthermore, their atmospheres can
show equatorial super-rotation via strong eastward jet streams, and/or
high-altitude winds flowing from the day- to the night-side hemisphere. Planet
rotation and atmospheric circulation broaden and distort the planet spectral
lines to an extent that is detectable with measurements at high spectral
resolution. We observed a transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b around 2.3
{\mu}m and at a spectral resolution of R~10$^5$ with CRIRES at the ESO Very
Large Telescope. After correcting for the stellar absorption lines and their
distortion during transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), we detect the
absorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission
spectrum by cross-correlating with model spectra. The signal is maximized
(7.6{\sigma}) for a planet rotational velocity of $(3.4^{+1.3}_{-2.1})$ km/s,
corresponding to a rotational period of $(1.7^{+2.9}_{-0.4})$ days. This is
consistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days and therefore with tidal
locking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day
(3{\sigma}). The data only marginally (1.5{\sigma}) prefer models with rotation
versus models without rotation. We measure a small day- to night-side wind
speed of $(-1.7^{+1.1}_{-1.2})$ km/s. Compared to the recent detection of
sodium blue-shifted by (8$\pm$2) km/s, this likely implies a strong vertical
wind shear between the pressures probed by near-infrared and optical
transmission spectroscopy.
