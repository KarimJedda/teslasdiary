    <h1>Measuring intermediate mass black hole binaries with advanced gravitational wave detectors. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By John Veitch, Michael PÃ¼rrer, Ilya Mandel</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>We perform a systematic study to explore the accuracy with which the
parameters of intermediate-mass black-hole binary systems can be measured from
their gravitational wave (GW) signatures using second-generation GW detectors.
We make use of the most recent reduced-order models containing inspiral, merger
and ringdown signals of aligned-spin effective-one-body waveforms (SEOBNR) to
significantly speed up the calculations. We explore the phenomenology of the
measurement accuracies for binaries with total masses between 50 and 500
$M_\odot$ and mass ratios between 0.1 and 1. We find that (i) at total masses
below ~200 $M_\odot$, where the signal-to-noise-ratio is dominated by the
inspiral portion of the signal, the chirp mass parameter can be accurately
measured; (ii) at higher masses, the information content is dominated by the
ringdown, and total mass is measured more accurately; (iii) the mass of the
lower-mass companion is poorly estimated, especially at high total mass and
more extreme mass ratios; (iv) spin cannot be accurately measured for our
injection set with non-spinning components. Most importantly, we find that for
binaries with non-spinning components at all values of the mass ratio in the
considered range and at network signal-to-noise ratio of 15, analyzed with
spin-aligned templates, the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole with
mass &gt;100 $M_\odot$ can be confirmed with 95% confidence in any binary that
includes a component with a mass of 130 $M_\odot$ or greater.
