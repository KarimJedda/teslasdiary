    <h1>Correlations between compositions and orbits established by the giant impact era of planet formation. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Rebekah I. Dawson, Eve J. Lee, Eugene Chiang</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>The giant impact phase of terrestrial planet formation establishes
connections between super-Earths' orbital properties (semimajor axis spacings,
eccentricities, mutual inclinations) and interior compositions (the presence or
absence of gaseous envelopes). Using N-body simulations and analytic arguments,
we show that spacings derive not only from eccentricities, but also from
inclinations. Flatter systems attain tighter spacings, a consequence of an
eccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which increase
eccentricities, and mergers, which damp them. Dynamical friction by residual
disk gas plays a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping
inclinations and eccentricities. Systems with moderate gas damping and high
solid surface density spawn gas-enveloped super-Earths with tight spacings,
small eccentricities, and small inclinations. Systems in which super-Earths
coagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with low solid surface density,
produce rocky planets with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and larger
mutual inclinations. A combination of both populations can reproduce the
observed distributions of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet
multiplicities, and transit duration ratios exhibited by Kepler super-Earths.
The two populations, both formed in situ, also help to explain observed trends
of eccentricity vs. planet size, and bulk density vs. method of mass
measurement (radial velocities vs. transit timing variations).
