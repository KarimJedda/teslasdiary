    <h1>Limits on the significant mass-loss scenario based on the globular clusters of the Fornax dSph. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Pouria Khalaj, Holger Baumgardt</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>Many of the scenarios proposed to explain the origin of chemically peculiar
stars in globular clusters (GCs) require significant mass-loss ($\ge95\%$) to
explain the observed fraction of such stars. In the GCs of the Fornax dwarf
galaxy significant mass-loss could be a problem. Larsen et al. (2012) showed
that there is a large ratio of GCs to metal-poor field stars in Fornax and
about $20-25\%$ of all the stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-2$ belong to the four
metal-poor GCs. This imposes an upper limit of $\sim80\%$ mass-loss that could
have happened in Fornax GCs. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by suggesting that stars can leave the Fornax galaxy. We use a series
of $N$-body simulations, to determine the limit of mass-loss from Fornax as a
function of the initial orbital radii of GCs and the speed with which stars
leave Fornax GCs. We consider a set of cored and cuspy density profiles for
Fornax. Our results show that with a cuspy model for Fornax, the fraction of
stars which leave the galaxy, can be as high as $\sim90\%$, when the initial
orbital radii of GCs are $R=2-3\,\rm{kpc}$ and the initial speed of stars is
$v&gt;20\,\rm{kms}$. We show that such large velocities can be achieved by gas
expulsion induced mass-loss but not stellar evolution induced mass-loss. Our
results imply that one cannot interpret the metallicity distribution of Fornax
field stars as evidence against significant mass-loss in Fornax GCs, if
mass-loss is due to gas expulsion.
