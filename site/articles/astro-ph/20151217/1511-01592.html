    <h1>Second Einstein Telescope Mock Data and Science Challenge: Low Frequency Binary Neutron Star Data Analysis. </h1>

        <p>The Einstein Telescope is a conceived third generation gravitational-wave
detector that is envisioned to be an order of magnitude more sensitive than
advanced LIGO, Virgo and Kagra, which would be able to detect
gravitational-wave signals from the coalescence of compact objects with
waveforms starting as low as 1Hz. With this level of sensitivity, we expect to
detect sources at cosmological distances. In this paper we introduce an
improved method for the generation of mock data and analyse it with a new low
latency compact binary search pipeline called gstlal. We present the results
from this analysis with a focus on low frequency analysis of binary neutron
stars. Despite compact binary coalescence signals lasting hours in the Einstein
Telescope sensitivity band when starting at 5 Hz, we show that we are able to
discern various overlapping signals from one another. We also determine the
detection efficiency for each of the analysis runs conducted and and show a
proof of concept method for estimating the number signals as a function of
redshift. Finally, we show that our ability to recover the signal parameters
has improved by an order of magnitude when compared to the results of the first
mock data and science challenge. For binary neutron stars we are able to
recover the total mass and chirp mass to within 0.5% and 0.05%, respectively.
