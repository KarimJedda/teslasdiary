    <h1>Identification of Mars gully activity types associated with ice composition. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Mathieu Vincendon</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>The detection of geologically recent channels at the end of the twentieth
century rapidly suggested that liquid water could have been present on Mars up
to recent times. A mechanism involving melting of water ice during ice ages in
the last several million years progressively emerged during years following the
first observations of these gullies. However, the recent discovery of current
activity within gullies now suggests a paradigm shift where a contemporary CO2
ice-based and liquid water-free mechanism may form all gullies. Here we perform
a survey of near-infrared observations and construct time sequences of water
and CO2 ice formation and sublimation at active gully sites. We observe that
all major new erosive features such as channel development or lengthening
systematically occur where and, if applicable, when CO2 ice is observed or
probable. CO2 ice layers are however estimated to be only 1 mm to 1 cm thick
for low-latitude sites, which may have implication for potential formation
mechanisms. We also observe that part of current gully activity, notably the
formation of some new deposits, is poorly compatible with the presence of CO2
ice. In particular, all new bright deposits reported in the literature have a
low CO2 ice probability while water ice should be present at most sites. Our
results confirm that CO2 ice is a key factor controlling present-day channel
development on Mars and show that other mechanisms, potentially involving
sublimation or melting of water ice, are also contributing to current gully
activity.
