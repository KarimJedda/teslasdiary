    <h1>Grammage of cosmic rays around Galactic supernova remnants. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Marta D&#x27;Angelo, Pasquale Blasi, Elena Amato</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>The residence time of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Galaxy is usually inferred
from the measurement of the ratio of secondary-to-primary nuclei, such as the
boron (B)/carbon (C) ratio, which provides an estimate of the amount of matter
traversed by CRs during their propagation, the so called CR grammage. However,
after being released by their parent sources, for instance supernova remnants
(SNRs), CRs must cross the disc of the Galaxy, before entering the much lower
density halo, in which they are believed to spend most of the time before
eventually escaping the Galaxy. In the near-source region, the CR propagation
is shown to be dominated by the non-linear self-generation of waves. Here we
show that due to this effect, the time that CRs with energies up to $\sim$ 10
TeV spend within a distance $L_{c}\sim 100$ pc from the sources is much larger
than naive estimates would suggest. The corresponding grammage is close to
current estimates of the total grammage traversed throughout the whole Galaxy.
Moreover, there is an irreducible grammage that CRs traverse while trapped
downstream of the shock that accelerated them, though this contribution is
rather uncertain. We conclude that at energies $\lesssim 1$ TeV, the observed
grammage is heavily affected by the near-source non-linear trapping of CRs, and
at energies $\gtrsim 1$ TeV it is affected by the source grammage. As a result,
the measurement of the B/C ratio should be used very cautiously as an indicator
of the propagation of CRs on large Galactic scales.
