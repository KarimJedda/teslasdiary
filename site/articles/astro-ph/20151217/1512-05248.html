    <h1>A practical theorem on using interferometry to measure the global 21-cm signal. </h1>

        <p>The sky-averaged, or global, background of redshifted 21-cm radiation is
expected to be a rich source of information on the history of re-heating and
re-ionization of the intergalactic medium. However, measuring the signal is
technically challenging: one must extract the small, frequency-dependent signal
from under the much brighter spectrally smooth foregrounds. Traditional
approaches to study the global signal have used single-antenna systems, where
one must calibrate out frequency-dependent structure in the overall system gain
(due e.g. to internal reflections) as well as remove the noise bias from
auto-correlating a single amplifier output. This has motivated several
proposals to measure the global background using interferometric setups, where
the signal appears in cross-correlation and where additional calibration
techniques are available. In this paper, we focus on the general principles
that drive the sensitivity of any interferometric setup to the global signal.
In particular, we prove that this sensitivity is directly related to two
characteristics of the setup: the cross-talk between the readout channels (i.e.
the signal picked up at one antenna when the other one is driven) and the
correlated noise due to thermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers
or the ground) radiating into both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup,
one cannot suppress cross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing
sensitivity to the global signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge
is to characterize these effects and their frequency dependence. We illustrate
our general theorem by explicit calculations within toy setups consisting of
two short-dipole antennas in free space, and above a perfectly reflecting
ground surface.
