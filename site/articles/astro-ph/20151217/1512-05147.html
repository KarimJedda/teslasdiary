    <h1>Observations of solar flares with IRIS and SDO. </h1>

        <p>Context: Flare kernels brighten simultaneously in all SDO/AIA channels making
it difficult to determine their temperature structure. IRIS is able to
spectrally resolve Fe xxi emission from cold chromospheric brightenings, so can
be used to infer the amount of Fe xxi emission in 131 channel. Aims: We use
observations of two small solar flares seen by IRIS and SDO to compare the EMs
deduced from the IRIS Fe xxi line and the AIA 131 channel to determine the
fraction of Fe xxi emission in flare kernels in the 131 channel of AIA.
Methods: Cotemporal and cospatial pseudo-raster AIA images are compared with
the IRIS results.We use multi-Gaussian line fitting to separate the blending
chromospheric emission so as to derive Fe xxi intensities and Doppler shifts in
IRIS spectra. Results: We define loop and kernel regions based on the
brightness of the 131 and 1600 {\AA} intensities. In the loop regions the Fe
xxi EMs are typically 80% of the 131 ones, and range from 67% to 92%. Much of
the scatter is due to small misalignments but the largest site with low Fe xxi
contributions was probably affected by a recent injection of cool plasma into
the loop. In flare kernels the contribution of Fe xxi increases from less than
10% at the low intensity 131 sites to 40-80% in the brighter kernels. Here the
Fe xxi is superimposed on bright chromospheric emission and the Fe xxi line
shows blue shifts, sometimes extending up to the edge of the spectral window,
200 km/s. Conclusions: The AIA 131 emission in flare loops is due to Fe xxi
emission with a 10-20% contribution from continuum, Fe xxiii, and cooler
background plasma emission. In bright flare kernels up to 52% of the 131 is
from cooler plasma. The wide range seen in the kernels is caused by significant
structure in the kernels which is seen as sharp gradients in Fe xxi EM at sites
of molecular and transition region emission.
