    <h1>High S/N Keck and Gemini AO imaging of Uranus during 2012-2014: New cloud patterns, increasing activity, and improved wind measurements. </h1>

        <p>We imaged Uranus in the near infrared from 2012 into 2014, using the
Keck/NIRC2 camera and Gemini/NIRI camera, both with adaptive optics. We
obtained exceptional signal to noise ratios by averaging 8-16 individual
exposures in a planet-fixed coordinate system. noise-reduced images revealed
many low-contrast discrete features and large scale cloud patterns not seen
before, including scalloped waveforms just south of the equator. In all three
years numerous small (600-700 km wide) and mainly bright discrete features were
seen within the north polar region (north of about 55\deg N). Over 850 wind
measurements were made, the vast majority of which were in the northern
hemisphere. These revealed an extended region of solid body rotation between
62\deg N and at least 83\deg N, at a rate of 4.08$\pm0.015$\deg/h westward
relative to the planet's interior (radio) rotation of 20.88\deg/h westward.
Near-equatorial speeds measured with high accuracy give different results for
waves and small discrete features, with eastward drift rates of 0.4\deg/h and
0.1\deg/h respectively. The region of polar solid body rotation is a close
match to the region of small-scale polar cloud features, suggesting a dynamical
relationship. While winds at high southern latitudes (50\deg S - 90\deg S) are
unconstrained by groundbased observations, a recent reanalysis of 1986 Voyager
2 observations by Karkoschka (2015, Icarus 250, 294-307) has revealed an
extremely large north-south asymmetry in this region, which might be seasonal.
Greatly increased activity was seen in 2014, including the brightest ever
feature seen in K' images (de Pater et al. 2015, Icarus 252, 121-128). Over the
2012-2014 period we identified six persistent discrete features. Three were
tracked for more than two years, two more for more than one year, and one for
at least 5 months and continuing.
