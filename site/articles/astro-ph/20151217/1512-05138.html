    <h1>On the behaviour of streams in angle and frequency spaces in different potentials. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Hans J.T. Buist, Amina Helmi</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>We have studied the behaviour of stellar streams in the Aquarius fully
cosmological N-body simulations of the formation of Milky Way halos. In
particular, we have characterised the streams in angle and frequency spaces
derived using an approximate but generally well-fitting spherical potential. We
have also run several test-particle simulations to understand and guide our
interpretation of the different features we see in the Aquarius streams. Our
goal is both to establish which deviations of the expected action-angle
behaviour of streams exist because of the approximations made on the potential,
but also to derive to what degree we can use these coordinates to model streams
reliably. We have found that many of the Aquarius streams wrap in angle space
along relatively straight lines, and distribute themselves along linear
structures also in frequency space. On the other hand, from our controlled
simulations we have been able to establish that deviations from spherical
symmetry, the use of incorrect potentials and the inclusion of self-gravity
lead to streams in angle space to still be along relatively straight lines but
also to depict wiggly behaviour whose amplitude increases as the approximation
to the true potential becomes worse. In frequency space streams typically
become thicker and somewhat distorted. In all cases, the energy gradient along
the stream seems almost intact in frequency space, but this is not the case for
angle space. Therefore, our analysis explains most of the features seen in the
approximate angle and frequency spaces for the Aquarius streams (...) Since the
measured angle-frequency misalignments of the Aquarius streams can largely be
attributed to using the wrong (spherical) potential, the determination of the
mass growth history of these halos will only be feasible once (and if) the true
potential has been determined robustly.
