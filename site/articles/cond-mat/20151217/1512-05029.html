        <p>Boron is the fifth element in the periodic table and possesses rich chemistry
second only to carbon. A striking feature of boron is that B12 icosahedral
cages occur as the building blocks in bulk boron and many boron compounds. This
is in contrast to its neighboring element, carbon, which prefers 2D layered
structure (graphite) in its bulk form. On the other hand, boron clusters of
medium size have been predicted to be planar or quasi-planar, such as B12+ ,
B13+, B19-, B36, and so on. This is also in contrast to carbon clusters which
exhibit various cage structures (fullerenes). Therefore, boron and carbon can
be viewed as a set of complementary chemical systems in their bulk and cluster
structures. Now, with the boom of graphene, an intriguing question is that
whether boron can also form a monoatomic-layer 2D sheet structure? Here, we
report the first successful experimental realization of 2D boron sheets. We
have revealed two types of boron sheet structures, corresponding to a
triangular boron lattice with different arrangements of the hexagonal holes.
Moreover, our boron sheets were found to be relatively stable against
oxidization, and interacts only weekly with the substrate. The realization of
such a long expected 2D boron sheet could open a door toward boron electronics,
in analogous to the carbon electronics based on graphene.
