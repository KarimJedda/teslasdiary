    <h1>Vacancies in the Kitaev quantum spin liquids on the 3D hyper-honeycomb lattice. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By G. J. Sreejith, Subhro Bhattacharjee, R. Moessner</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>We study the effect of adding disorder to the exactly solvable Kitaev model
on the hyper-honeycomb lattice, which hosts both gapped and gapless spin liquid
phases with an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The latter has an unusual
gapless spectrum of Majorana fermion excitations, with a co-dimension-two Fermi
ring. We thus address the question of the interplay of topological physics and
disorder by considering the properties of isolated single and pair of
vacancies. We show that near the vacancies, the local magnetic response to a
field $h_z$ is parametrically enhanced in comparison to the pristine bulk.
Unlike the previously studied case of the 2D honeycomb Kitaev model, the
vacancies do not bind a flux of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. In the gapped
phase, an isolated vacancy gives rise to effectively free spin-half moments
with a non-universal coupling to an external field. In the gapless phase, the
low-field magnetization is suppressed parametrically, to $(-\ln h_z)^{-1/2}$
because of interactions with the surrounding spin-liquid. We also show that a
pair of vacancies is subject to a sublattice-dependent interaction on account
of coupling through the bulk spin liquid, which is spatially anisotropic even
when all Kitaev couplings have equal strength. This coupling is thus
exponentially suppressed with distance in the gapped phase. In the gapless
phase, two vacancies on the same (opposite) sublattice exhibit an enhanced
(suppressed) low-field response, amounting to an effectively
(anti-)ferromagnetic interaction.
