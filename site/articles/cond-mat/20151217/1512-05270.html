        <p>Boron, the fifth element in the periodic table, is a fascinating material
with rich chemical properties. The bonding states in boron are rather complex,
ranging from two-center bond to multi-center bond, forming a large family of
allotropes. Although boron has been discovered for more than two centuries, its
crystalline form was only synthesized half a century ago. Until now, only
several allotropes of crystalline boron have been confirmed to be stable:
{\alpha}-rhombohedral, \b{eta}-rhombohedral, T-192 and {\gamma}-B28, and most
of these allotropes are semiconductors, with a large band gap at the Fermi
level. Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, there is a boom of research on
monolayer materials, such as silicene, germanene and so on. Monolayer boron has
also been intensively studied using first-principles calculations. However,
experimental synthesis of monolayer boron has been realized only until
recently. In contrast to the semiconducting properties of its bulk allotropes,
monolayer boron is predicted to be metallic. The metallic boron is
complementary to its semiconductor allotropes, making it possible to realize
the high-efficient all-boron nano-devices. However, the electronic properties
of boron remain to be understood. Here, we synthesized monolayer boron on
Ag(111) and determined its band structure using angle resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARPES). We observed one electron pocket at the S point and one
pair of electron pockets near the X point, which agrees well with our
first-principles calculation results. The chemical properties have been
investigated by in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our results
provide the first experimental evidence for the metallic character of monolayer
boron.
