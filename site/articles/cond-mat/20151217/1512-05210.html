    <h1>Volatilities analysis of first-passage time and first-return time on a small-world scale-free network. </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Junhao Peng</p>
    <content class="mn-demo">
        <p>
        <p>In this paper, we study random walks on a small-world scale-free network,
also called as pseudofractal scale-free web (PSFW), and analyze the
volatilities of first passage time (FPT) and first return time (FRT) by using
the variance and the reduced moment as the measures. Note that the FRT and FPT
are deeply affected by the starting or target site. We don't intend to
enumerate all the possible cases and analyze them. We only study the
volatilities of FRT for a given hub (i.e., node with highest degree) and the
volatilities of the global FPT (GFPT) to a given hub, which is the average of
the FPTs for arriving at a given hub from any possible starting site selected
randomly according to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain.
Firstly, we calculate exactly the probability generating function of the GFPT
and FRT based on the self-similar structure of the PSFW. Then, we calculate the
probability distribution, the mean, the variance and reduced moment of the GFPT
and FRT by using the generating functions as a tool. Results show that: the
reduced moment of FRT grows with the increasing of the network order $N$ and
tends to infinity while $N\rightarrow\infty$; but for the reduced moments of
GFPT, it is almost a constant($\approx1.1605$) for large $N$. Therefore, on the
PSFW of large size, the FRT has huge fluctuations and the estimate provided by
MFRT is unreliable, whereas the fluctuations of the GFPT is much smaller and
the estimate provided by its mean is more reliable. The method we propose can
also be used to analyze the volatilities of FPT and FRT on other networks with
self-similar structure, such as $(u, v)$ flowers and recursive scale-free
trees.
