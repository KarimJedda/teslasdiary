    <h1>Greybody factors for Schwarzschild black holes: Path-ordered exponentials and product integrals. </h1>

        <p>In recent work concerning the sparsity of the Hawking flux
[<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1506.03975">arXiv:1506.03975v2</a>], we found it necessary to re-examine what is known
regarding the greybody factors of black holes, with a view to extending and
expanding on some old results from the 1970s. Focussing specifically on
Schwarzschild black holes, we re-calculated and re-assessed the greybody
factors using a path-ordered-exponential approach, a technique which has the
virtue of providing a semi-explicit formula for the relevant Bogoliubov
coefficients. These path-ordered-exponentials, (being based on a "transfer
matrix" formalism), are closely related to so-called "product integrals",
leading to quite straightforward and direct numerical evaluation, while
avoiding any need for numerically solving differential equations. Furthermore,
while considerable analytic information is already available regarding both the
high-frequency and low-frequency asymptotics of these greybody factors,
numerical approaches seem better adapted to finding suitable "global models"
for these greybody factors in the intermediate frequency regime, where most of
the Hawking flux is concentrated. Working in a more general context, these
path-ordered-exponential techniques are also likely to be of interest for
generic barrier-penetration problems.
