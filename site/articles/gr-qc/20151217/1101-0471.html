    <h1>Heun Functions and their uses in Physics. </h1>

        <p>Most of the theoretical physics known today is described using a small number
of differential equations. For linear systems, different forms of the
hypergeometric or the confluent hypergeometric equations often suffice to
describe the system studied. These equations have power series solutions with
simple relations between consecutive coefficients and/ or can be represented in
terms of simple integral transforms. If the problem is nonlinear, one often
uses one form of the Painlev\'e equations. There are important examples,
however, where one has to use higher order equations. Heun equation is one of
these examples, which recently is often encountered in problems in general
relativity and astrophysics. Its special and confluent forms take names as
Mathieu, Lam\'e and Coulomb spheroidal equations. For these equations whenever
a power series solution is written, instead of a two way recursion relation
between the coefficients in the series, we find one between three or four
different ones. An integral transform solution using simpler functions also is
not obtainable. Here this equation will be introduced and examples for its use,
especially in general relativity literature will be given.
